To do:
- ~~Make the joint practice sentence percentage text reflect the number of correct sentence reponses for the loop, instead of just the set~~
- Implement main test
    - ~~make the joint practice block usable for main test~~s
    - ~~Hide stimili/routines when it is the main test~~
    - ~~Calculate and log final scores after main test~~
- Fix bug of practice sentence not logging in csv: this might affect logging for main test
    - No such bug during main test, so no priority/value fixing this.

Test checklist
- ~~sentence score with all accuracy error~~
- ~~sentence score with all speed error~~
- ~~sentence score with all correct~~
- ~~sentence score with mix of the above~~
- ~~rspan score with 0 score~~
- ~~rspan score with full score~~
- ~~rspan score with some corrects and incorrects~~
